# Pixel-Invaders
----- Space Invaders made in z80 assembly language ------

This file is code for pixelated version of old school 'Space Invaders' for arcade/GameBoy. The spaceship is one pixel large, while the 'aliens' are in two rows, moving across the screen in pattern: three right, one down, three left, one down. 

The code can be run on the original version of Sinclair ZX Spectrum.
